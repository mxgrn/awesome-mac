# My favorite macOS apps

Very opinionated list of best macOS apps. I use these daily after considering a bunch of alternatives.

## Time tracking and utils

- [Tyme](https://www.tyme-app.com/en/) - very polished app for tracking time and putting up basic invoices
- [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) - automatic time tracking when no invocing is needed, integrates with NeoVim
- [Pandan](https://sindresorhus.com/pandan) - minimalistic "time awareness" app (reminds to have a break)
- [iSmartClock](https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/ismartclock/id706803884?mt=12) - nice minimalist desktop clock for Mac

## Terminal

- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

## Automation

- [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)
- BetterTouchTool

## Postgres client

- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) - recently got lots of great new features

## Mail client

- [MailMate](https://freron.com/) - no-BS email client that allows conveniently deleting all messages from the same sender, a time saver

## RSS client

- [ReadKit](https://readkit.app/)

## Personal knowledge base

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## Screenshots

- [Xnip](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xnip-screenshot-annotation/id1221250572)

## Battery health

- [AlDente](https://apphousekitchen.com/) -- prevents battery from charging to 100%

## Audio

- [eqMac](https://eqmac.app/) -- I use it to get the best out of my MBP's speakers, and the free version is perfectly enough for that.

## Multi-display support

- [AutoRaise](https://github.com/sbmpost/AutoRaise) (Experimental) â€” Automatically focuses the window under the mouse pointer. When moving the mouse to another display, it restores intuitive behavior by eliminating the need for an additional click to focus the window.
